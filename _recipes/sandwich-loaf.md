This is a soft, tender sandwich loaf recipe for baking in a clay loaf pan. The cold start method and enriched dough create a fine, even crumb perfect for slicing.

I make this in my Emile Henry Pullman/Long Loaf Bread Baker, but any clay or ceramic loaf pan with a lid will work well.

## Ingredients

- Bread flour: 400g
- Water: 260g
- Milk: 40g
- Salt: 8g
- Sugar or honey: 15g
- Neutral oil or melted butter: 20g
- Instant yeast: 6g

## Instructions

1. **Mix**
Combine all ingredients until no dry flour remains.

2. **Rest**
Cover and rest 15 minutes.

3. **Knead**
Knead about 5 minutes, until smooth and elastic.

4. **Bulk ferment**
Cover and let rise until doubled, 60–90 minutes.

5. **Shape**
Gently flatten, roll into a tight log.

6. **Pan**
Place seam-side down in the loaf pan. No spray needed; parchment is optional.

7. **Final proof**
Cover loosely; rise until 1–2 cm below the rim, 30–45 minutes.

8. **Bake (cold start)**
Put pan in a cold oven. Set to 375°F / 190°C.

**If using a lid:**
- Lid on 30 minutes, then remove
- Total bake: 40–45 minutes

9. **Cool**
Rest in pan 5–10 minutes, then turn out and cool completely.
