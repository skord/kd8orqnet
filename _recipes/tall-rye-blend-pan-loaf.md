This is a tall, hearty rye-blend loaf with excellent rise and structure. The combination of vital wheat gluten and non-diastatic malt powder helps achieve a tall, strong loaf with good flavor. This is one of my favorites and go-to recipes, I make it at least once a week.

I make this in an 8.5×4.5 USA Pan. The dough weight is approximately 830g with about 71% hydration.
