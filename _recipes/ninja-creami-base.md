This is a basic base recipe for the Ninja Creami ice cream maker. It can be used as a starting point for various flavors. It makes about 500ml of base before it is processed in the machine if you don't add anything to it. The xanthan gum and guar gum help with the texture and creaminess of the ice cream, but you can omit them if you prefer a simpler recipe.

I have a Ninja Creami Deluxe, but this recipe should work with the original Ninja Creami as well. The main difference is that the Deluxe has a larger capacity and more features, but the basic process remains the same. You might need to adjust the amount of ingredients slightly based on your machine's capacity.

## Ingredients
- **1 cup (240ml) whole milk**
- **1 cup (240ml) heavy cream**
- **1/2 cup (100g) sugar**
- **1 tsp vanilla extract**
- **1/16 tsp xanthan gum**
- **1/8 tsp guar gum**
- **1/8 tsp salt**

## Instructions

1. **Combine all ingredients** in a bowl.
   - If using cocoa or matcha, bloom in hot water first.
   - If using xanthan gum, sprinkle it in while whisking to avoid clumps.

2. **Whisk gently** until sugar is dissolved.
   - Avoid high-speed blending to prevent foam.
   - Let the mixture sit for 5â€“10 minutes to allow bubbles to rise, then stir gently.

3. **Pour into Creami Deluxe pint container**

4. **Freeze flat for 24 hours**.
