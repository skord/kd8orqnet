This is a simple rustic white bread recipe optimized for baking in a clay loaf pan. The higher temperature and optional lid create a crispy, crackly crust with a tender interior. Surface tension during shaping is key to a good rise and crust.

I make this in my Emile Henry Pullman/Long Loaf Bread Baker, but any clay or ceramic loaf pan with a lid will work well. The lid traps steam, enhancing crust development.

## Ingredients

- Bread flour: 400g
- Water: 300g
- Salt: 8g
- Instant yeast: 3g

## Instructions

1. **Mix** Combine flour, water, yeast, and salt until no dry flour remains. Dough will be sticky and shaggy.

2. **Rest (autolyse)**
Cover and rest 20 minutes. This is actually important.

3. **Knead briefly**
Knead 3–4 minutes, just until it starts to smooth out. It will still feel tacky.

4. **Bulk ferment**
Cover and let rise until about 1.75× volume, not fully doubled. About 75–90 minutes.

5. **Shape**
Turn out gently, degas lightly, shape into a tight log. Surface tension matters here.

6. **Pan**
Place seam-side down in the loaf pan. Do not grease heavily; parchment on the bottom only if you're nervous.

7. **Final proof**
Cover loosely and let rise until the dough is about 1 cm below the rim. Do not overproof, the crust suffers if you do. About 30–40 minutes.

8. **Score**
Just before baking, score lengthwise about 1 cm deep. This helps controlled expansion and better crust.

9. **Bake (hot start)**
Preheat the oven to 425°F / 220°C. Put the pan in once the oven is hot.

**If you have a lid:**
- Lid on for 20 minutes
- Lid off for 20–25 minutes

**No lid:**
- Bake uncovered 40–45 minutes total

**Optional Crust Boost:**
Crack the oven door for the last 5 minutes to vent steam.

**Cool Fully:**
This loaf will crackle as it cools. Do not cut early.
