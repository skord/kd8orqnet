## Ingredients

- 1 medium red cabbage
- 2-3 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: 1-2 cloves garlic, minced
- Optional: 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar or apple cider vinegar

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Remove any damaged or wilted outer leaves from the red cabbage. Cut the cabbage into quarters, and then remove the core from each quarter.

3. Slice each cabbage quarter into 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) thick wedges, keeping the layers of each wedge together as much as possible.

4. Place the cabbage wedges on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, ensuring that each wedge is evenly coated. If using minced garlic, distribute it evenly over the cabbage wedges.

5. Season the cabbage wedges with salt and pepper to taste.

6. Roast the cabbage in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are slightly charred and the cabbage is tender.

7. Optional: If using balsamic vinegar or apple cider vinegar, drizzle it over the roasted cabbage wedges immediately after removing them from the oven. This will add a tangy, sweet flavor to the dish.

8. Serve the roasted red cabbage as a side dish, or incorporate it into salads, grain bowls, or warm sandwiches. Enjoy!
