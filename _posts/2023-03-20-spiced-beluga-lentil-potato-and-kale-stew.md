## Ingredients
- 1 cup beluga lentils, rinsed and drained
- 2 cups diced potatoes (preferably red or yellow)
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
- 4 cups chopped kale, stems removed
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh lemon juice, for serving
- Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped, for garnish

## Instructions
1. Set your Instant Pot to the "Sauté" function and heat olive oil. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 3-4 minutes until it becomes translucent.
2. Add minced garlic and sauté for another minute. Then, add the turmeric, cumin, smoked paprika, coriander, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper (if using). Stir well to combine and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Add the diced potatoes and beluga lentils to the Instant Pot, stirring to coat them evenly with the spices.
4. Pour in the vegetable broth and diced tomatoes (with their juices). Stir well, making sure to scrape any bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.
5. Place the lid on the Instant Pot and set it to "Pressure Cook" or "Manual" mode on high pressure. Cook for 15 minutes.
6. Once the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes, then carefully perform a quick release for any remaining pressure.
7. Open the Instant Pot and stir in the chopped kale. Replace the lid and let the residual heat wilt the kale for about 3-4 minutes.
8. Taste the stew and adjust the salt and pepper as needed. Stir in a generous squeeze of fresh lemon juice for added brightness.
9. Serve the stew hot, garnished with chopped cilantro or parsley.

Enjoy your spiced beluga lentil, potato, and kale stew! This dish is not only flavorful and warming, but also packed with nutrients and protein from the lentils and kale.
