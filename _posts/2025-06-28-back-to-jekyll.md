I spent a good while buying into the “all your notes in one place” hype—second brains, Zettelkasten, Markdown for everything, and so on. I tried to make Obsidian my one-stop shop for notes, writing, research, and whatever else people think is the answer to their organization problems.

It didn’t really stick.

## 1. Meeting Notes Actually Need a Calendar

Agenda.app just does a better job for meetings. Integrated calendar, timestamps, context—you know, things you actually need for meetings. Obsidian can technically do it if you throw enough plugins at it, but why bother? Agenda just works.

## 2. Obsidian Is Fine for Writing, But That’s It

Obsidian’s good for longer-form writing or documentation, sure. But for “quick capture” or the endless little scraps that accumulate, I’d forget where things lived, or I’d end up with a mess of half-connected notes. There’s a limit to how many times you can reorganize a note before you realize the system isn’t helping.

## 3. Obsidian Publish: Pricey and Not Flexible

Obsidian Publish seemed like a nice way to get my notes online—until I realized I kept forgetting it even existed. It’s not cheap, either, and it doesn’t offer the flexibility I want. You get what they give you.

## 4. No Support for Multiple Domains

Another big one: I need to point multiple domains at my published notes. Obsidian Publish doesn’t support that. With Jekyll, it’s trivial—point as many domains as you want, set up whatever redirects you need, and move on with your life.

## 5. Out of Sight, Out of Mind

The reality is, I just didn’t think about Obsidian Publish when I was note-taking or writing. If you’re going to bother putting something on the web, you should be able to control it, update it easily, and *remember* you have it.

## Why I’m Back on Jekyll

So, I’m switching back to Jekyll. I get total control over publishing. The workflow fits my brain—write in Markdown, push to GitHub, site’s updated. No monthly fee, no vendor lock-in, no trying to shoehorn everything into a system that promises to make you smarter.

Obsidian’s still fine for long-form notes or projects, but I don’t need a “second brain.” One is more than enough work already.

## Copying Back
I had some interesting content I'd written on the Obsidian Publish site and I'll work on copying it back here. It might take a bit, but I think it’s worth it to have everything in one place again.
