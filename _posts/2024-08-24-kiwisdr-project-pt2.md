It’s alive… and noisy. I’m already picking up WSPR reports and am reporting into [pskreporter](https://pskreporter.info/pskmap.html?preset&callsign=KD8ORQ&mapCenter=35.42167819271155,-83.37994186583147,3.9325572880613575). with some pretty good spots.

I do not have everything permanently mounted yet, but the magloop is in the KiwiSDR and it’s alive. I opted for a metal case for the SDR and it came with a VERY noisy fan which is going to necessitate it being removed from my room where it currently resides. I’m not talking RF noise, the fan is **loud**.

There’s some RF noise problems but it’s not bad at all.

The KiwiSDR v1 is a Beaglebone Black based linux box and it has interesting security to say the least as it’s really meant to be a plug and play radio more than anything else. Once I’m more comfortable with how that works I will be probably making use of the proxy service so everyone can use it.

Did I mention this thing is noisy?
