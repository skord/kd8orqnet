### Ingredients

4. Cook on high pressure for 15-20 minutes, depending on how soft you like your beans. If you prefer firmer beans, cook for 15 minutes, and for softer beans, cook for 20 minutes.
5. Once the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes before quick releasing any remaining pressure.
