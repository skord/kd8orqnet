Blondies are often referred to as the delicious cousin of brownies. While they share a similar texture, blondies swap out the cocoa powder for a brown sugar base, resulting in a lighter, caramel-like flavor. Our butterscotch blondies take this classic dessert to the next level by incorporating butterscotch chips, which provide an extra burst of sweetness and a touch of nostalgia.

Whether you're looking for a special treat to share with friends and family, or you simply want to indulge in a bit of baking therapy, these butterscotch blondies are guaranteed to satisfy. They're quick and easy to make, requiring only a handful of ingredients and minimal effort. So, let's dive into the recipe and start baking!

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
* 1 cup light brown sugar, packed
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 cup butterscotch chips

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to **350°F (180°C)**. Grease and line an **8-inch (20 cm) square baking pan** with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on two opposite sides for easy removal.

2. In a **large mixing bowl**, combine the **melted butter** and **light brown sugar**. Stir until smooth and well combined.

3. Add the **egg** and **vanilla extract** to the butter and sugar mixture. Mix until fully incorporated.

4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the **all-purpose flour**, **baking powder**, **salt**, and **baking soda**. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

5. Fold in the **butterscotch chips**.

6. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, spreading it evenly with a spatula.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for **20-25 minutes** or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist crumbs attached.

8. Remove the blondies from the oven and let them cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Once cooled, use the parchment paper overhang to lift the blondies out of the pan. Slice into squares and enjoy!
