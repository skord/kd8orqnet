I can't tell you all the history, but once upon a time there was a Columbus, Ohio–based company called Roll. They started as a local bike shop that did fittings with some sort of laser machine, but eventually they got into making their own bikes. The idea was simple: build bikes people actually wanted to ride. The models were straightforward, shared similar frames, and were just plain fun. As far as I remember, none of them had a front derailleur — just seven speeds in the back.

My first Roll was the A:1 City, set up for just bopping around town. It was perfect for errands and short rides, but when I started pushing into 40+ mile territory, it wasn’t cutting it.

So I bought their A:1 Adventure. This bike was more robust, with a wider gear range and geometry built for longer hours in the saddle. It wasn’t a race bike, or a road bike, or really a touring rig, but it could do towpaths, gravel, and still keep up on pavement. This was before gravel bikes started showing up all over YouTube. It came stock with drop bars, 700x40c tires, all the mounts you could want, mechanical disc brakes, and it was generally a tank.

And I should say — it *is* a tank. Mine has slowly become a bit of a frankenbike, but on purpose. I’ve been through many saddles but finally landed on the Bontrager Aeolus Comp in 155mm. Yes, it’s marketed as an aero saddle, but on this frame it feels right — both upright and in the drops.

The pedals had to go too. Stock pedals are always just for show. I swapped in Crankbrothers Stamp 1 Gen 2 (large), which suit me better. I am PROUDLY not a “cyclist,” but I love riding bikes. None of mine require me to dress up to ride — though I won’t say no to padded shorts.

Next up: Panaracer GravelKing SS+ tires. Believe it or not, I’m still on the stock rubber years later.

And if you spotted the Quadlock mount on the bars: yeah, regret. The mount itself works, but the cases are expensive and I haven’t had one last a season — they warp under UV and weather, even with me riding only 3 days a week. I’ll probably switch to Peak Design at some point.

It’s not the lightest, it’s not the newest, but it’s mine. And every time I throw a leg over it, I’m glad I didn’t let this one slip away when Roll closed up shop. I miss everyone in the Lane Ave store but still see them around town and this is a great reminder of all those people who made that happen.
