### Ingredients:

* 2 cans (15.5 oz each) of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1 can (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1-inch piece of ginger, minced
* 1-2 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to taste)
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)
* 1/2 tsp garam masala
* 1/2 tsp fenugreek powder (methi)
* 1 tsp amchur (dry mango powder) or 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* Salt, to taste
* Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish

### Instructions:

1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan or skillet over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onions and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are soft and golden brown.
3. Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent them from sticking to the pan.
4. Add the ground turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, red chili powder, garam masala, and fenugreek powder. Stir well to combine and cook for a minute to release the flavors of the spices.
5. Add the canned diced tomatoes, along with their juice, and mix well. Cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the tomatoes to break down and the flavors to meld together.
6. Add the drained and rinsed chickpeas to the pan. Stir well to coat them in the tomato-spice mixture.
7. Add 1 cup of water to the pan, and season with salt, to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the chana masala thickens to your desired consistency.
8. Stir in the amchur powder or lemon juice to add tanginess to the dish.
9. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more salt, chili powder, or amchur/lemon juice as needed.
10. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot with rice, naan, or your favorite Indian bread.
